## code checklist
- [ ] create makefile for http and https compile
  - use -Wall -Wextra -O2 -std=c++17 with clang++
  - for flags: -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto
- [ ] write description README
  - describe project purpose (HTTP/HTTPS file server)
  - how to compile and run
  - any prerequisites (e.g., OpenSSL, Linux only)
- [ ] inherit HTTPS from HTTP class and overload using openSSL  
  openSSL functionality to be used:
  - SSL_new()
  - SSL_set_fd()
  - SSL_accept() (performs the handshake)
  - SSL_read() / SSL_write() instead of read() / write()  
  we create bind and accept the socket with POSIX but then hand off to openSSL
  for encrypted TLS
- [ ] make server.cpp use cmd line args for port and domain/ip
  - --port <number> (defaults to 80)
  - --domain or --ip

## deployment checklist
- [ ] domain name -> ip
- [ ] port forwarding (443 â†’ my machine)
- [ ] assign static LAN IP to server
- [ ] generate SSL certs (lets encrypt)
- [ ] allow HTTPS through firewall
